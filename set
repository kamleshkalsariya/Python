Sets:
iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements.
S = set(list/string)
S = {2,3,4,5}
S.add(6)------------add only one element,Lists cannot be added to a set as elements whereas Tuples can be added because tuples are immutable.
S.update()--------------------add multiple element,accepts lists, strings, as well as other sets as its arguments.
Set items cannot be accessed by referring to an index But you can loop through the set items using a for loop.
S.remove(value)--------if element not present it will give keyerror
S.discard(value)-------if element not present it will not give keyerror
S.pop()--------------remove arbitary element
S.clear()--------------remove all elements
a.union(b)------------- Values which exist in a or b
a.intersection(b) -----------Values which exist in a and b
a.difference(b)--------------- Values which exist in a but not in b
